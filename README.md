# Semantics Chllenge 
<!--Dez Duran-->



<!--Project Title-->
Module 1 Challenge

<!--Project Description-->
A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible

When viewing the HTML and CSS, I was able to find the following issues:

   Divs were used instead of semantic elements:
   such as: 
   header, 
   nav, 
   section,
   aside,
   and footer

I replaced the divs with semantic elements mentioned above and added alt attributes to the images.
allowing screen readers to share the website information with the visually impaired..
